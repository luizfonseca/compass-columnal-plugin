Columnal Grid System - Compass Plugin
================================

Columnal is a responsive CSS grid system helping desktop and mobile browsers play nicely together.
See the official site for more info: <http://www.columnal.com//>

* This plugin is consistent with latest version of Columnal as of 10/01/2012

---------

This plugin adds the Columnal Grid System framework to [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).
This plugin is heavly based upon the 960.gs compass plugin written by Chris Eppstein and Matt Sanders.
I've tried to use the same mixin names whenever possible to make a migration easier.

Install
=======

First add to your Gemfile:

    gem "compass-columnal-plugin"

Then run:

    bundle install

Finally you add a `config/compass.rb` file to your project containing:

    require 'columnal'

Class-Based Grid System
=======================

To create a grid system that works like the original Columnal Grid System framework
use the `+grid-system-complete` mixin to generate the corresponding classes:

Example:
    
    +grid-system-complete

Making Semantic Grids
=====================

Let's say we have a 12 columns layout, and we want to use the `<section>` tag as a row in the grid:
```css
    body
      +grid-container
      section
        +grid-row
        header
          +grid-column(12)
        article
          +grid-column(9)
        aside
          +grid-column(3)
          +last
```

So we could use the following HTML:

    <body>
      <section>
        <header>This header has 12 columns</header>
        <article>Here we have 9 columns</article>
        <aside>And here 3</aside>
      </section>
    </body>
